        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</p>
        <h2>Abstract</h2><p>Timeline-based set visualizations provide an overview of how overlapping categorical data evolves. We study three different visualization techniques of such type and made minor modifications to visualize the same data in a two-fold comparison. First, we contrast their encodings and interactions through a conceptual analysis. Second, in a user study with 28 participants, we evaluate their performance regarding different analysis tasks for dynamic sets and record user feedback along various dimensions.</p>
