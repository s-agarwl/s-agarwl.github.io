        <h2>Abstract</h2><p>Visual analytics is widely adopted in iterative data science/analytic workflows where the human-in-the-loop uses the visualizations to make sense of the data. We are interested in the in-depth analysis of the surveys conducted for studying the effectiveness of public health programs, for which we propose the use of visual analytics. Here, a collaboration between researchers in public health and visualization has led to co-creation of workflows enabling visual analytic techniques for subject-centric raw data from the surveys. We build an appropriate data model which feeds into our proposed visualization techniques. We present a prototype implementation of our tool, SurveyVis, and demonstrate the usage of our tool in analyzing a public health program deployed in India.</p>
