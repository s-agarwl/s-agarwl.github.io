# Easily create and host your academic website on GitHub Pages

I have created this repository to help anyone create and host their website on GitHub Pages. I wanted creating, hosting, and updating the website (e.g., new publications) to be as easy as possible. You dont need to be a web developer to make changes. You just need to make changes to a `json` file to enter your information (e.g., name) and add publication in a `bib` file. YOU DONT NEED TO COMPILE THE CODE. I PROMISE!

See an example of a website created using this repository at [https://s-agarwl.github.io/](https://s-agarwl.github.io/).

For more details, see the documentation in the [/public/docs.md](./public/docs.md) file.
