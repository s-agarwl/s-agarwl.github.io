        "original": "Competition and collaboration form complex interaction patterns between the agents and objects involved. Only by understanding these interaction patterns, we can reveal the strategies the participating parties applied. In this paper, we study such competition and collaboration behavior for a computer game. Serving as a testbed for artificial intelligence, the multiplayer bomb laying game Pommerman provides a rich source of advanced behavior of computer agents. We propose a visualization approach that shows an overview of multiple games, with a detailed timeline-based visualization for exploring the specifics of each game. Since an analyst can only fully understand the data when considering the direct and indirect interactions between agents, we suggest various visual encodings of these interactions. Based on feedback from expert users and an application example, we demonstrate that the approach helps identify central competition strategies and provides insights on collaboration.",

As a result, it becomes challenging to visualize the temporal change in set membership of elements across several timesteps while showing individual set intersections. We propose Set Streams, a visualization technique that represents changing set structures on a timeline as branching and merging streams. The streams encode the changing membership of elements with set intersections. A query-based selection mechanism supports a flexible comparison of selected groups of elements across the temporal evolution. The main timeline view is complemented with additional panels to provide details about the elements. While the proposed visualization is an application-independent visualization technique for dynamic sets, we demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability through three diverse application examples and expert feedback.",

To analyze their performance, in an application study, we have developed VisCoMET, a visual analytics approach displaying interactions of healthcare personnel in a triage training of a mass casualty incident. The application scenario stems from social interaction research, where the collaboration of teams is studied from different perspectives. We integrate recorded annotations from multiple sources, such as recorded videos of the sessions, transcribed communication, and eye-tracking information. For each session, an information-rich timeline visualizes events across these different channels, specifically highlighting interactions between the team members. We provide algorithmic support to identify frequent event patterns and to search for user-defined event sequences. Comparing different teams, an overview visualization aggregates each training session in a visual glyph as a node, connected to similar sessions through edges. An application example shows the usage of the approach in the comparative analysis of triage training sessions, where multiple teams encountered the same scene, and highlights discovered insights. The approach was evaluated through feedback from visualization and social interaction experts. The results show that the approach supports reflecting on teams performance by exploratory analysis of collaboration behavior while particularly enabling the comparison of triage training sessions.",

Hierarchical communities in SWN aid in managing and understanding the complex network better. To enable a visual analytics workflow to probe and uncover hierarchical communities, we propose to use both the network data and metadata (e.g. node and link attributes). Hence, we propose to use the network topology and node-similarity graph using metadata, for knowledge discovery. For the construction of a four-level hierarchy, we detect communities on both the network and the similarity graph, by using specific community detection at specific hierarchical level. We enable the flexibility of finding non-overlapping or overlapping communities, as leaf nodes, by using spectral clustering. We propose NodeTrix-CommunityHierarchy (NTCH), a set of visual analytic techniques for hierarchy construction, visual explo ration and quantitative analysis of community detection results. We extend NodeTrix-Multiplex framework (Agarwal et al., 2017), which is for visual analytics of multilayer SWN, to probe hierarchical communities. We propose novel visualizations of overlapping and non-overlapping communities, which are integrated into the framework.

However, there still exists a gap between the awareness of benefits of MBT and its adoption in the industry, specifically in the Computer Aided Design (CAD) or Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) domains. This can be predominantly attributed to the learning curve of using many of the existing MBT tools. To address this gap in the CAD/CAE industry, we propose Pathfinder - an MBT tool, with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), for guiding a software tester in generating test plans for a system-under-test (SUT). The goal of using Pathfinder is for obtaining consistency and reproducibility in the generated test plans across a team of software testers. Our tool introduces a novel representation of the SUT as a High-level Model (HLM), and the use of graph visualization for test plan generation from the HLM. We have designed the GUI to be intuitive for the tester to generate test plans and select re levant tests, which precedes the test execution done outside of our tool. Here, we discuss the design decisions we adopted towards creating Pathfinder, and demonstrates its usage with two case studies.",

We analyze which aspects of these related visualizations can be leveraged for analyzing user sessions in virtual and mixed reality environments and describe a design and application space for such visualizations. First, we examine what information is typically generated in interactive virtual and mixed reality applications and how it can be analyzed through such visualizations. Next, we study visualizations from related research fields and derive seven visualization categories.

The VRSP is concerned with scheduling trips in traffic networks and the re-scheduling of vehicles when disruptions occur, for example the breakdown of a vehicle. While solving the VRSP in various settings has been an active area in operations research (OR) for decades, the ever-growing complexity of modern railway networks makes dynamic real-time scheduling of traffic virtually impossible. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has successfully tackled challenging tasks where many agents need to be coordinated, such as multiplayer video games. However, the coordination of hundreds of agents in a real-life setting like a railway network remains challenging and the Flatland environment used for the competition models these real-world properties in a simplified manner. Submissions had to bring as many trains (agents) to their target stations in as little time as possible. While the best submissions were in the OR category, participants found many promising MARL approaches. Using both centralized and decentralized learning based approaches, top submissions used graph representations of the environment to construct tree-based observations. Further, different coordination mechanisms were implemented, such as communication and prioritization between agents. This paper presents the competition setup, four outstanding solutions to the competition, and a cross-comparison between them.\t",

The analysis could help answer important questions: How does the relationship between group members change over time? What is the effect of an action of a member on others? How do group members coordinate their efforts to achieve a goal? What are the overall changes in group behaviors over time? This thesis proposes novel techniques for visually exploring group dynamics, thereby aiding in answering such questions. The proposed techniques apply to diverse scenarios, as demonstrated through application examples. This work focuses on the two characteristic features of group dynamics. First, since members can belong to multiple groups simultaneously, it results in overlaps between groups. We propose two novel visualizations to analyze dynamic memberships in overlapping groups. Their effectiveness is demonstrated by insights from application examples, e.g., authors evolving research interests, classification models performance in their training process, and developer contributions in software repositories. Second, the interactions among group members. A design and application space is proposed to explore user behaviors from mixed reality sessions. Three visualizations are presented to investigate collaborative and competitive interactions among members. The studied scenarios include humans interacting in mixed reality and autonomous agents collaborating and competing in simulated environments. We propose an example of an integrated visual representation to show dynamic memberships in overlapping groups and entity interactions. The thesis discusses the future possibilities in encoding enriched interactions and describes a few works in progress. Finally, the thesis summarizes the contributions, highlights the limitations of the proposed visualizations, and presents a brief outlook toward the future.",
