# My Journey into Data Visualization and AI

My path has been a fascinating evolution from a systems engineer to a computer science researcher with a focus on visual analytics and artificial intelligence. This journey has been marked by a persistent curiosity about how we can make complex data more accessible and actionable through visualization.

After beginning my career as a Systems Engineer at Infosys, I pivoted toward the exciting world of data visualization during my time at the Graphics Visualization Computing Lab at IIITB. There, I discovered my passion for developing visual tools that could help people understand complex systems and datasets.

## Research Evolution

My research journey demonstrates a consistent theme: making complex data understandable. Starting with ["NodeTrix-Multiplex"](/publications/Agarwal2017Nodetrix) for visualizing community structures in networks, I progressively tackled more complex challenges in dynamic data visualization. My work on ["Set Streams"](/setstreams) and ["Layered Set Intersection Graphs"](/dynamicsets) introduced novel ways to visualize changing group memberships over time.

A significant focus of my work has been visualizing AI behavior. Projects like ["Bombalytics"](/bombalytics) and my analysis of multi-agent scheduling behaviors in the Flatland competition showcase my ability to develop visualization techniques that help understand how AI agents interact, compete, and collaborate [(1)][1] [(2)][2].

## Award-Winning Innovations

My research has been recognized with several prestigious awards. I'm particularly proud of the First Prize in the NeurIPS 2020 Flatland competition for my visual analytics solution to understand multi-agent AI behaviors, and the Best Paper Award at VMV 2020 for my work on visualizing dynamic overlapping sets.

## Looking Forward

Today, while exploring the path ahead, I remain committed to bridging the gap between advanced technology and human understanding, creating tools that empower people to derive actionable insights from complex data.

My academic background, coupled with practical experience across various domains, has equipped me with a unique perspective on how data visualization and AI can be leveraged to solve complex problems. I'm excited about the future possibilities in this rapidly evolving field.
