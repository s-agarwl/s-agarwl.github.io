While testing video games is essential, it can be expensive and time-consuming when done by people. Instead, AI can be used to play the games, gathering valuable data. This data is too large to analyze manually, so it is summarized and visualized to make it understandable and improve the game design. This project builds on a previous bachelor project, creating a system to help visualize and understand how AI learns and evolves in games.",

    "description": "Through analysis of 30 articles from six local media outlets, this thesis studies local journalism already incorporates data elements similar to national publications, but with a unique local focus. The research develops four innovative storytelling concepts: text-centric with visual extensions, visualization-centric with text support, time-based topic summaries, and map-based article organization. Expert interviews with journalists confirm the potential of data-driven storytelling in local contexts while highlighting resource constraints. This work provides actionable insights for modernizing local journalism through interactive data visualization, ensuring communities maintain access to professional, engaging local news in the digital age.",
