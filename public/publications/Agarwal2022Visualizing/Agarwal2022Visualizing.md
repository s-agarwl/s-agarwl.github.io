## How We Made AI’s Learning Visible

When AI agents learn to play a game, they start like beginners—confused, making random moves, and often failing. Over time, they improve, developing strategies and teamwork. But here’s the challenge:

**How do we see this learning process happening?**

AI training usually happens behind the scenes, buried in numbers and complex formulas. We wanted to change that. **Our research focuses on visualizing how AI agents evolve their collaboration and strategies over time.**

### Why Does This Matter?

AI isn’t just about playing games—it’s about learning how to **work together**. Whether it’s:

- **Autonomous cars** coordinating in traffic,
- **Warehouse robots** optimizing package deliveries, or
- **Energy grids** balancing power supply,

AI agents need to **learn teamwork** to be effective in the real world. But understanding how AI improves its collaboration over time has been a missing piece—until now.

### Making AI’s Learning Process Visible

We built a **visualization tool** that tracks AI’s teamwork skills over time. We trained AI agents in **Pommerman**, a bomb-laying strategy game, and at regular intervals, we measured **13 different teamwork behaviors**—like how often agents shared power-ups, avoided friendly fire, or set up strategic bomb chains.

Then, using our visualization, we could **see** how these behaviors evolved, what strategies emerged, and how they contributed to winning games.

**Key insights our visualization revealed:**

- **When** the AI learned key behaviors (like bomb-chaining for better attacks).
- **How** different teamwork behaviors correlated with winning.
- **Which strategies led to failure**, helping refine AI training methods.

### What’s Next?

By making AI’s learning process **visible and understandable**, we enable better AI training across **robotics, automation, and multi-agent systems**. Instead of treating AI as a "black box," our approach helps **refine strategies, detect problems early, and provide a path to build smarter AI systems for real-world applications**.
